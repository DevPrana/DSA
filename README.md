## Time Complexity
---
Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken to run the algorithm as a function of the length of input.
It does not represent the time taken to execute all the statements in an algorithm rather it gives information on the varaitions in time when we increase the number of operations in the algorithm

Ex. An algorithm might take different amount of time to run in different machines but time complexity represnts the amount of time taken as we increase or decrease the statements inside our code.

### Big-Oh 'O' notation:
Represents the worst case complexity of an algorithm
